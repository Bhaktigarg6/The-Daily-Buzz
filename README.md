🙋‍♀️ About Me
Hey there! I’m Bhakti Garg, a curious mind currently in my 3rd year of Computer Science at Banasthali Vidyapith 💡
I love building things that actually work — that connect people, solve real-world problems, or just look cool doing it 💻✨

I’m mostly in the backend zone (PHP + MySQL), but I’ve been exploring front-end magic and APIs too. Projects like SkillSwap are where I turn ideas into code.

🎯 Focused. Practical. Always learning.

Let’s connect and build something impactful:
